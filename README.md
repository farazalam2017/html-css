## Haunting the Past

This section documents my learning journey from the Udemy course:  
[**Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS**](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

In this course, I learned modern HTML5 & CSS3 techniques, best practices for responsive design, and how to build visually appealing, accessible, and performance-optimized websites.

As part of the course, I collaborated with a friend via GitHub to build this project:

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- You must **understand CSS fundamentals** before you can adapt it to your needs.
- Modern frameworks (Tailwind CSS, shadcn, etc.) are built on **pure CSS concepts**.
- Theory is useless unless applied to **real-world projects and coding tasks**.
