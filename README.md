This section documents my learning journey from the Udemy course:  
[**Build Responsive Real-World Website with HTML and CSS**](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

Here, I explore modern HTML5 and CSS3 techniques, best practices for responsive design, and how to build visually appealing, accessible, and performance-optimized websites.
